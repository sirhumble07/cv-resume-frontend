        <h3>Terraform CI/CD Pipeline (Automated Infrastructure Provisioning)</h3>
        <p><strong>Deployments were slow, inconsistent, and manually executed, creating configuration drift across environments.</strong></p>
        <p>I built a fully automated IaC pipeline enabling safe, repeatable, and version- controlled deployments.</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created modular Terraform architecture using remote state, workspaces, state locking, and reusable VNET/NSG/storage modules.</li>
